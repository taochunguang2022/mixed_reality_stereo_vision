# mixed_reality_stereo_vision
A study on the characterization of stereoscopic visual fatigue induced by mixed reality environments. We focused on EEG and peripheral physiological signals. Specifically, We recorded 24-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 23 healthy participants and combined them with electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory, and skin temperature data from 13 participants. These physical signal characteristics were extracted and combined into corpus. Among them, EEG signals are recorded through [the NeuSen W wireless EEG acquisition system](http://www.neuracle.cn/), peripheral physiological signals are collected by [the ErgoLAB intelligent wearable sensors](https://resources.ergolab.cn/), and visual stimuli are presented through [Microsoft HoloLens2](https://www.insight.com/en_US/shop/partner/microsoft/hardware/hololens.html).

## EEG pre-processing procedure
The "resting_state_eeg" folder represents the preprocessed EEG data from 23 participants. The specific preprocessing steps are outlined below:

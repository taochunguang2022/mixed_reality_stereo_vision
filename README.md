# mixed_reality_stereo_vision
A study on the characterization of stereoscopic visual fatigue induced by mixed reality environments. We focused on EEG and peripheral physiological signals. Specifically, We recorded 24-channel EEG signals from 23 healthy participants and combined them with electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory, and skin temperature data from 13 participants. These physical signal characteristics were extracted and combined into corpus.
